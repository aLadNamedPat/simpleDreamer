# World Model

### Implementation Details:

This is my re-implementation of the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10122 and works towards my goal of a complete Dreamer implementation.

The model design is pretty simple, we have a VAE that learns a latent representation of an image. This latent representation is fed into a RNN that learns to predict next latent predictions over time.

More details will be added as model is trained and fully complete.
